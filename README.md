## üìÑ XML Extractor

XML Extractor is a lightweight desktop tool that scans any file for valid raw XML files, extracts them, formats them, and saves them. It can be used for various purposes, including game modding - such as for Codemasters' 2009 title, **Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising**.

- Per-file output folders named after your source (dots ‚Üí underscores)  
- Animated, always-visible progress bar  
- Overwrite prompts in a custom, on-brand dialog  
- Embedded Red Hat Display Bold font for crisp headings  
- Auto-scrolling log box that shows timestamps and details  

## üì• Installation

XML Extractor is fully portable‚Äîno installer required. Download the latest release from **[Releases](https://github.com/NoahDomingues/XML-Extractor/releases)**, unzip, and launch:

- **Windows**: Double-click `XML Extractor.exe`.  
- **Linux/Mac**: Use [WINE](https://www.winehq.org) or Mono (`mono XML\ Extractor.exe`)‚Äîuntested but often works.
