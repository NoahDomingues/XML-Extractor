## üìÑ XML Extractor

XML Extractor is a lightweight desktop tool that scans any file for valid `<?xml version="‚Ä¶">` prologs, pulls out each XML fragment, pretty-prints it, and saves it to its own folder. Whether you‚Äôre reverse-engineering game executables, unpacking proprietary containers, or simply mining text files for embedded XML, this app makes it batch-friendly, safe, and visually clear.

Built with WPF and styled in a modern dark/red theme, XML Extractor features:  
- Per-file output folders named after your source (dots ‚Üí underscores)  
- Animated, always-visible progress bar  
- Overwrite prompts in a custom, on-brand dialog  
- Embedded Red Hat Display Bold font for crisp headings  
- Auto-scrolling log box that shows timestamps and details  

## üì• Installation

XML Extractor is fully portable‚Äîno installer required. Download the latest release from **[Releases](https://github.com/NoahDomingues/XML-Extractor/releases)**, unzip, and launch:

- **Windows**: Double-click `XML Extractor.exe`.  
- **Linux/Mac**: Use [WINE](https://www.winehq.org) or Mono (`mono XML\ Extractor.exe`)‚Äîuntested but often works.

1. Click **Select File‚Ä¶** to choose a single file, or **Select Folder‚Ä¶** to target a directory.  
2. Hit **Extract** to begin scanning.  
3. Watch the red progress bar fill, and follow detailed messages in the log.  
4. Extracted XML files appear in `YourFileName_ext` folders, named like `RootTag_01.xml`, `RootTag_02.xml`, etc.  

XML Extractor never hides the progress bar, and prompts you before overwriting existing output folders.
